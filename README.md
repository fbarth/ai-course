# Code for Artificial Intelligence course

I am using this project to support the exercises in an Artificial Intelligence course that is part of undergraduate courses at [ESPM](http://international.espm.br/). The topics discussed in this A.I. course are: 

1.	Artificial Intelligence Introduction;
2.	Intelligent Agents;
3.	Solving Problems by Searching;
4.	Informed Search Methods;
5.	Game Playing, and;
6.	Reinforcement Learning (I present in this course the concept of Learning from Observations, Supervised Learning and Unsupervised Learning. However, I have a specific course to discuss those topics. You can access this material [here](https://github.com/fbarth/ml-espm)).
